We will use the `titanic` dataset, which is a classic dataset in the machine learning community. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck or not. For this, you will use the dataset provided in the `train.csv` file.\n",

    "7. Up to this point, we surely have a clear idea of which variables could be predictors of the ability to survive the sinking of the Titanic. With this information, we can write a simple Rule-based system to predict whether a passenger survives or not. Create a function which, based on a rule or set of rules, determines (\"predicts\") if a passenger will survive or not. For example: Suppose my rule is that all passengers with age > 80 years do not survive. Then my rule would be: if Age > 80, Prediction = 0\n",
