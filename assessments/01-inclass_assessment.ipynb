    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Shell Basics**:\n",
    "    -   Open your terminal or command line interface.\n",
    "    -   Identify which shell you are using with the command `echo $SHELL`.\n",
    "    -   Use `man` or `--help` to look up the manual for the `ls` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Getting Help**:\n",
    "    -   For each of the following commands, use `--help` or `man` to find out what they do: `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Navigating Your System**:\n",
    "    -   Navigate to your home directory using `cd`.\n",
    "    -   List all the files and directories in your home directory with a detailed view using `ls -l`.\n",
    "    -   Create a new directory called `econ725_assessment`. Hint: use `mkdir`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Managing Files**:\n",
    "\t-   Copy any text file from your system (you can use those ones covered in class) into this directory and rename it to `sample.txt`. Hint: use `cp` and `mv`.\n",
    "    -   Inside `econ725_assessment`, create a new file called `my_script.sh`. Hint: use `touch`.\n",
    "    -   Write a bash script in `my_script.sh` that performs all the following tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Working with Text Files**:\n",
    "    -   Inside your bash script, use `cat` to display the contents of an existing text file (`sample.txt`).\n",
    "    -   Use `head` to display the first 10 lines of `sample.txt` and `tail` to display the last 10 lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Redirects, Pipes, and Loops**:\n",
    "    -   In your bash script, redirect the output of `ls -l` to a file named `directory_list.txt`.\n",
    "    -   Use a pipe (`|`) to sort `directory_list.txt` alphabetically and display the sorted content with `less`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Scripting**:\n",
    "    -   In your bash script, include a command that prints \"Hello, Data Science!\" to the terminal.\n",
    "    -   Make `my_script.sh` executable using `chmod`, and then run the script. Use the manual command to find out how to make a script executable ðŸ™‚.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Creating and Concatenating Files**:\n",
    "    -   In your bash script, create a folder called `texts` inside the `econ725_assessment` directory.\n",
    "    -   Inside the `texts` folder, create 5 text files (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, etc.) using a **for loop**. Each file should contain a short message, like \"This is file 1.\", \"This is file 2.\", and so on.\n",
    "    -   Use a command to concatenate the contents of all the text files into one final file called `all_texts.txt`. Ensure this file is saved in the `texts` folder."

    "### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Compress the `econ725_assessment` directory with all created files into a `.zip` file and submit it through Canvas (See Assignments). - Name the zip file `FirstName_LastName_econ725_assessment.zip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria for grade**: The submission will be graded based on the completion of the tasks and the correctness of the commands used. I will check your bash script and the output files/folders generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Remember to replace `FirstName` and `LastName` with your actual last and first names."
