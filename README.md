## Course description ##

This course focuses on programming and data management, with an emphasis on building skills
for economic analysis and data science. You will learn how to access and manipulate various
types of datasets, including tabular data, text data, and social network data. You will learn
essential computer literacy and concepts, and workflows for reproducible research. By the end
of the course, you will have gained computing skills that can be applied to real-world big data
scenarios. The course will use popular data analysis software such as R and Python, and
leverage cloud computing for enhanced data processing capabilities.


## Learning Outcomes ##

This course will equip students with the skills to create fully reproducible data analysis
pipelines. Upon completing this course, students will be able to acquire, organize, explore, and
construct basic statistical models to analyze economic data and present reports in a dashboard.
By the end of the course, students will be proficient in:

* Developing collaborative, reproducible workflows using Git and GitHub for version
control.
* Running these workflows on a local and remote computers with tools like command line
operations and Github Codespaces.
* Executing workflows in a containerized environment using Docker for comprehensive
reproducibility.
* Implementing workflows in a virtual environment with cloud computing tools.
* Developing dashboards and data visualizations with appropriate software.
* Implementing efficient code in Python and R following best coding practices.

## Grades ##

Grades will be based on the categories listed below with the corresponding weights. More information on Canvas.
