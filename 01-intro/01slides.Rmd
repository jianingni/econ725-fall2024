# Introduction


### Course Description 

- This course focuses on programming and data management, with an emphasis on building skills for economic analysis and data science. 
- You will learn how to access and manipulate various types of datasets and will equip you with the skills to create fully reproducible data analysis pipelines. 
- Upon completing this course, students will be able to acquire, organize, explore, and construct basic data science models to analyze economic data and present reports in a dashboard.

# Why this course?

Fill in the gaps left by traditional econometrics and methods classes.

- Practical skills with tools that will benefit your future career.
- Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

Data science skills are highly valuable in private and public sector!

- Data viz, cleaning and wrangling; programming; cloud computation; relational databases; machine learning; etc.

# Set up Checklist

- For this course, we are going to use most of the time cloud computing tools.
- There are several options to choose from, but we are going to use [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), [Databricks Community Edition](https://www.databricks.com/) and [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/quickcreate?experience=power-bi)/[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students).
- Before next class, I want you to go over the following checklist:

â˜‘ Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account (This is your first in-class assessment. See Canvas.)
  - You will soon receive an invitation to the course organization on GitHub, as well as [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com), which is how we'll disseminate and submit assignments, receive feedback, grading, etc. 

â˜‘ Create a [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/try-databricks#account) account
